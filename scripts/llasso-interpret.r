## Note that at the end, we will identify the original SNPs by 
## X0[common[kept[i]]], the ith column in X is actually the kept[i]
## column in X prior to elimination of repeated columns, and
## the kept[i] column is then the common[kept[i]] in the original 
## bedfile before eliminating rare variants
