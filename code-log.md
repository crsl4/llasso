# To do
  - submit issue with Hua Zhou that convert creates different matrices each time!
  - submit issue with Kevin that all betas are negative with IHT
  - Where we are: we ran lasso for all chromosomes 1-23 for 22q data. We want to compare to existing hits from single regression
    - chr2,7,14,18 failed; chr5,19 did one part only
    - is there something strange in the code that all plots look alike?

  - check with rich/jai how to identify in which genes the significant SNPs are

Later:
  - meet with Rich to learn about amazon web
  - make functions more efficient: see `llasso-script.jl`, put functions in PostSelectionInference

# Scripts
- `llasso-script.jl`: for a given bedfile name, it runs:
  - cross validation with Lasso.jl to find the best lambda
  - cross validation with SparseRegression.jl to find the best lambda
  - penalized likelihood with Lasso.jl with best lambda
  - penalized likelihood with SparseRegression.jl with best lambda
  - penalized likelihood with IHT.jl
## Output files from llasso-script.jl
  - when reading bedfile, saved in `*.common` the indices of common SNPs kept in the model
  - when converting to float matrix, we save in `*.indices` the list of columns that are repeated; and in `*.indices-kept` we save the SNPs kept after removing the repeated columns (not allowed in post selection function)
  - cross validation julia objects saved in `*-crossval.jld`
  - `*.log` summary of Lasso.jl and SR.jl fit
  - all betas in `*.beta` file (one row per variable, one column per penalization)
  - `*-llasso.jld` to save the julia objects
  - `*.candidate` list of 50 SNPs with highest estimated effect overall penalties; used in the overfit of GLM adjusting for sex: GLM overfit results in `*.glm` and `*.glm-output`.
  - Note that at the end, we will identify the original SNPs by X[common[kept[i]]], the ith column in X is actually the kept[i] column in X prior to elimination of repeated columns, and the kept[i] column is then the common[kept[i]] in the original bedfile before eliminating rare variants
- `llasso-post-sel-preparation.jl`: will read the output files from  `llasso-script.jl`, create an Rda file
- `llasso-post-selection.r`: will run post selection methods in R (still under development)
- `llasso-interpret.r`: will read the *.beta file created by `llasso-script.jl` and will identify the significant variants (still under development)

# Results
- `test1` has the results when running the whole script in julia (before removing the RCall part that does not work in HGCC). It also uses the whole dataset (not just europeans)
- `test2`: run the whole `llasso-script.jl`, but after removing the RCall part that cannot be run in HGCC.

# HGCC

We need to install the necessary julia packages in HGCC in an interactive job:
```
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qlogin -q i.q
module load julia
module load R
which julia
##/sw/hgcc/Pkgs/julia/0.6.0/bin/julia
julia
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
## INFO: Initializing package repository /home/csolislemus/.julia/v0.6
Pkg.add("Distributions")
Pkg.add("Lasso") 
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/OpenMendel/SnpArrays.jl.git")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/joshday/SparseRegression.jl")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/klkeys/PLINK.jl.git")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/klkeys/RegressionTools.jl.git")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/klkeys/IHT.jl.git")
Pkg.add("RCall")
```
I get an error with `RCall`: "LoadError: Could not find R installation. Either set the "R_HOME" environmental variable, or ensure the R executable is available in "PATH".", even when I can call R:
```
$ which R
/sw/hgcc/Pkgs/R/3.3.2/bin/R
```
But inside R, we get:
```R
R.home()
##/sw/hgcc/Pkgs/R/3.3.2/lib64/R
```

From [here](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl/blob/master/docs/src/installation.md), we have the following instructions:
```
Firstly, try setting the R_HOME environmental variable to the location of your R installation, which can be found by running R.home() from within R. This can be set in your ~/.juliarc.jl file via the ENV global variable, e.g.

ENV["R_HOME"] = "/sw/hgcc/Pkgs/R/3.3.2/lib64/R"
```
I have done this, but I keep getting the same error. In [this issue](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl/issues/198), people mention that this is a problem when running in a cluster, and they suggest the solution of:
```
the solution was to rebuild the R installation with --enable-R-shlib and to add $R_HOME/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
```
So, I need to open another HGCC ticket. We are waiting for this. It was fixed by changing the version of R (needed 3.4+). It is ok that the two scripts are separated, but I will run `llasso-post-sel-preparation.jl` inside `llasso-script.jl`.
This was fixed by updating R to 3.4.

Now, we need to copy all the scripts to HGCC and the data:
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
mkdir 22q

cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts/
scp *.jl csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
We also need to copy the data:
```shell
cd Documents/gwas/data/22q/22q_files_NEW/bedfiles
ls
##22q-chr22.bed 22q-chr22.bim 22q-chr22.fam
scp * csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
Finally, we need to change the paths in the script to assume that everything is in the same folder.

Now we need to create the bash script for the job submission SGE: `llasso-submit.sh`. We need to copy it:
```
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts/
scp llasso-submit.sh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```

Now we can give it a try
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y 22q/llasso-submit.sh
##Your job 240967 ("llasso-submit.sh") has been submitted
```
Note that we cannot copy and paste into the terminal, we need to type it, otherwise we get the error:
`Unable to read script file because of error: error opening –q: No such file or directory`

However, the job does not appear when doing `qstat`, and there are a bunch of errors:
```
/bin/mktemp: too many templates
Try '/bin/mktemp --help' for more information.
cp: target ‘/home/csolislemus/22q/llasso-submit.sh’ is not a directory

```

The problem is that it cannot create the tmp folder.
It turns out that it was a hidden character in the submit file from copying from the slides. I had to rewrite the whole `llasso-submit.sh` and will copy again to HGCC:
```
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts/
scp llasso-submit.sh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```

So, we can give it another try:
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
cd 22q
qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y llasso-submit.sh
##Your job 240976 ("llasso-submit.sh") has been submitted
```
It appears to be running now. Need to check back with `qstat`.
It ran without error, but no output files were produced. I will rerun without deleting the tmp folder, and then ask if it is possible to check if the files were produced in there.
```shell
hgcc:node00:[22q] % qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y llasso-submit.sh
Your job 240979 ("llasso-submit.sh") has been submitted
hgcc:node00:[22q] % qstat
job-ID  prior   name       user         state submit/start at     queue                          slots ja-task-ID 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 240979 0.09375 llasso-sub csolislemus  r     12/04/2017 13:15:13 b.q@node09.local                   1 
```
Again, we do not have output files, and there are none in the scratch tmp file:
```shell
qlogin -q i.q@node09
cd /scratch/
node09:[scratch] % ls -l
drwx------ 2 csolislemus    epsteinlab          4096 Dec  4 13:15 qfXh6c
cd qfXh6c/
 ```
So, let's do a small test `test.jl` that only creates a data frame"
```shell
qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y test.sh
```
Everything works, and the test.csv file is created!

So, I will run line by line the submit llasso-submit.sh, and see if there is any error. 
`qlogin -q i.q`: node08. I think that the problem is that I do not have the package JLD. I am installing it now, but I am unable to because I need sudo permissions to install it. Viren installed HDF5, so I will test again if I can install JLD.
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qlogin -q i.q
module load julia
julia
```
Perfect! I was able to install and use `JLD` package. So now we will check the `llasso-submit.sh` script line by line. This will be run with the old 22q chromosome 22 data.

We got an error:
```
ERROR: LoadError: LoadError: Could not find R installation. Either set the "R_HOME" environmental variable, or ensure the R executable is available in "PATH".

Could this be a problem with running things in a screen? Maybe. Let's start the shell submit script and see what we get. First, we save whatever output from this first trial in folder `test1` in `output/22q`.
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qsub -q b.q llasso-submit.sh
## Your job 241199 ("llasso-submit.sh") has been submitted
```
and I have the same RCall error!

So, I will modify the script to avoid the R part. Also, I will do the overfitting part (not great) of refitting a model only with the candidate SNPs (in lieu of the post selection). This is not great because we are using the same data, but we have so little data (~500) to begin with.

Apparently the problem with RCall can be fixed by using version 0.9.0. But some dependecies force my RCall to be 0.8.1. I can check which packages have RCall as dependency with:
```julia
julia> Pkg.dependents("RCall")
4-element Array{AbstractString,1}:
 "RLEVectors"    
 "BioBridgeR"    
 "GenomicVectors"
 "PhyloNetworks" 

julia> Pkg.dependents("RLEVectors")
1-element Array{AbstractString,1}:
 "GenomicVectors"

julia> Pkg.dependents("BioBridgeR")
0-element Array{AbstractString,1}

julia> Pkg.dependents("GenomicVectors")
0-element Array{AbstractString,1}

julia> Pkg.dependents("PhyloNetworks")
0-element Array{AbstractString,1}
```

So, I will try to remove these and then re-install RCall:
```julia
 Pkg.rm("RLEVectors")    
 Pkg.rm("BioBridgeR")   
 Pkg.rm("GenomicVectors")
 Pkg.rm("PhyloNetworks")
 Pkg.rm("RCall")
```

This is very confusing:
```julia
julia> Pkg.rm("RLEVectors")
INFO: Package RLEVectors is not installed

julia> Pkg.rm("BioBridgeR")
INFO: Package BioBridgeR is not installed

julia> Pkg.rm("GenomicVectors")
INFO: Package GenomicVectors is not installed

julia> Pkg.rm("PhyloNetworks")
INFO: Package PhyloNetworks is not installed

But I will add RCall again: `Pkg.add("RCall")`, which still does not work, but now we have a different error:
```

Viren did something to R, and now everything works. We don't know what he did, he only said that he had to set some permissions on the R lib files.

Now, we need to copy again the `llasso-script.jl` to the cluster, as well as the covariates files, and run a test:
```
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts
scp llasso-*.jl csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
cd Documents/gwas/data/22q/22q_files_NEW/justfinalset
scp 22q_all.covariates.txt csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
Now, we need to login to HGCC in an interatice session and modify the paths of the llasso script:
```
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
cd 22q
vim llasso-script.jl ##and modify the paths
```

Now, we can test the llasso-submit.sh line by line (first we did `Pkg.update()`). Also, we need to change the paths of llasso-script.jl.
```
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qlogin -q i.q@node09
screen -S julia
module load julia
module load R
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`R RHOME`/lib
julia llasso-script.jl 
```
Now, we will check the output files:
```
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qlogin -q i.q@node09
screen -r julia
```
Sadly, screen was killed, not sure why. Will look at the files anyway.
There is something strange:
```
node09:[22q] % wc -l 22q-chr22.beta 
39455 22q-chr22.beta
node09:[22q] % wc -l 22q-chr22.indices-kept 
39436 22q-chr22.indices-kept
```
There are 39453 (without column names and intercept) beta coefficients, but only 39435 SNPs kept. There is a mismatch here, so I added a bunch of prints to `llasso-script.jl` and I am re-running to see what dimensions we have in the matrices and beta vectors. I ran `test3` with added prints, but still cannot identify why the discrepancy. Need more prints. The problem is with `identifyRepeatedColumns` that identifies different columns the second time: 
- first time: excluded 5230 columns
- second time (in post selection function): excluded 5248
So, `test3` has the excluded columns from post selection, and then, I will run `test4` without the the post selection functions, and compare these files.

It is the convert function that creates differente matrices!!!
```julia
julia> X = convert(Matrix{Float64},chr,impute=true);
julia> X2 = convert(Matrix{Float64},chr,impute=true);
julia> all(X .== X2)
false
```
Maybe this is the `impute` option, need to check this with Hua Zhou. So, we modified the `saveRda` function to use X and y as input, and need to re-check the output files.

Now, we will copy the new scripts to HGCC, and run one last test run over there.
```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts/
scp llasso-* csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
Now, we need to change the paths, and re-run:
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
```
Need to change paths in `llasso-script.jl` and `llasso-post-sel-preparation.jl`.
Now let's run `llasso-script.jl` in a screen first:
```shell
qlogin -q i.q@node09
screen -S julia
module load julia
module load R
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`R RHOME`/lib
julia llasso-script.jl 
```
Output files are fine, and now let's check that this works:
```shell
qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y 22q/llasso-submit.sh
qstat
```
All output files are great! 

Now, we need to copy the new `llasso-script.jl` that uses the caucasian data, and `llasso-post-sel-preparation.jl` that does not re-call functions/variables not needed when running inside `llasso-script.jl`:
```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/scripts/
scp llasso-script.jl csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
scp llasso-post-sel-preparation.jl csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```

Now, we need to copy the caucasian data to HGCC:
```shell
cd Documents/gwas/data/22q/22q_files_NEW/bedfiles
scp 22q_caucasian* csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
This takes a lot of time!

We also need to copy the covariance file:
```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/caucasian-ind
scp 22q_caucasian_outliers_removed.cov csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```

Now, we need to change the paths in `llasso-script.jl` again, and run a test in a screen:
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qlogin -q i.q@node09
screen -S julia
module load julia
module load R
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`R RHOME`/lib
julia llasso-script.jl 
```
Output files look good:
```
hgcc:node00:[22q] % wc -l 22q_caucasian-chr22.beta
36611 22q_caucasian-chr22.beta
hgcc:node00:[22q] % wc -l 22q_caucasian-chr22.indices-kept

```

I modified the `llasso-submit.sh` to run an array, so I need to copy again to HGCC:
```shell
scp llasso-submit.sh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q
```
And now we run in HGCC (fingers crossed!)
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
qsub -q b.q -cwd -j y 22q/llasso-submit.sh

Now we want to check if all chromosomes run:
```shell
ssh csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu
```
We moved the bed,bim,fam,jld files outside of 22q, and copied inside the `output-screen` files. Now we want to copy all the results to Dropbox:
```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/gwas/projects/22q_new/llasso/results/hgcc/
scp -r csolislemus@hgcc.genetics.emory.edu:/home/csolislemus/22q/* .
```
Later in HGCC, I moved all the output files to the folder `output` and left only the data files outside.
Now, we are using `llasso-interpret.r` to plot the results.

**Warning** There is a bug in IHT because all the betas are negative! Need to email Kevin.
